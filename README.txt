		Due to issues this git isn’t being used, added here for history purposes  				https://github.com/DarraghMacLochlainn/ToDoList-DEFUNCT-
       repos are public and should be accessed fine
       
Functionality:	A To-Do list where users can add and remove objectives for them to do, add users, update the objectives’ goals, times, likes and locations and users’ names, emails and password. Project can get all objectives made by a user and a user, and their objectives.

Persistence Approach:	Used mongodb but now uses mlab to store entries. Saves posts to 1 of 2 collections in the mlab database.

Git Approach:	After the day’s work was done, git was updated. This was forgotten for a couple days so push history does not accurately reflect work done.

DX Approach:	The program was worked along the notes until I could not get them to work. There was a focus on getting the basic routes done before deployment. Due to issues with Heroku and vue, they were ignored to focus on releasing the project.

Resources Used:	In-class notes provided by lecturer
